## 2. Results and Discussion

### 2.1 Torsion energy barriers are sensitive to the chemical environment which can be influenced by remote substituents

In most forcefields, torsions are defined by the quartet of atoms types involved in the dihedral [@doi:10.1021/ja00315a051; @doi:10.1021/ja00124a002; @doi:10.1002/jcc.540040211; @doi:10.1021/ja9621760].
Atom types encode chemical environments of atoms that usually only incorporate the local environment.
However, the quartet of atom types do not always capture all relevant chemistry, especially when the effects are nonlocal; atoms contributing to hyperconjugation, delocalization, or other nonclassical effects may not be part of the quartet involved in the torsion yet can influence the torsion profile [@doi:10.1186/s13321-019-0371-6].
In particular, with conjugated systems, distal electron-donating or -withdrawing substituents can exert a strong effect on torsional barrier height.

Simple examples can help illustrate this, such as the biphenyl example in different protonation states shown in Figure {@fig:biphenyls}, A.
While the MM torsion profiles are all the same (Figure @fig:biphenyls D), the QC torsion profiles are different for each protonation state (Figure @fig:biphenyls C).
The torsion energy barrier increases relative to the neutral state for the cation, anion, and zwitterion, in that order.
The profile changes qualitatively as well.
For the neutral molecule, the lowest energy conformer is slightly out of plane, at $150^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}$.
For the others, the lowest energy conformer is at $180^{\circ}$.
In the neutral molecule, the slightly out-of-plane conformer is preferred to accommodate the proximal hydrogens.
In the other cases, the increasing double-bond character of the conjugated central bond (shown for the zwitterion in Figure @fig:biphenyls B) makes the planar conformer preferred.

This trend poses problems to generalized torsion forcefield parametrization.
Most general forcefields consider the central bond in all tautomers equally rotatable so their MM torsion profiles are all the same (Figure @fig:biphenyls, D), while the QC scan clearly shows that they are not.
This illustrates one of the fundamental limits of atom types in classical forcefields:
At what point in this series should a new atom type be introduced?
In this case, remote changes three bonds away from the torsion central bond gradually perturbed the conjugated bond from being highly rotatable to non-rotatable as the conjugation increased.

### 2.2 The Wiberg bond order (WBO) quantifies the electronic population overlap between two atoms and captures bond conjugation

The Wiberg bond order (WBO) is a bond property that is calculated using atomic orbitals (AOs) that are used as basis sets in quantum and semi-empirical methods [@doi:10.1002/jcc.20494].
WBOs originally started within the CNDO formalism [@doi:10/fvwkkh], but has been extended to other semi-empirical methods such as AM1 [@doi:10.1021/ja00299a024] and PM3 [@doi:10.1002/jcc.540100208].
The WBO is a measure of electron density between two atoms in a bond and is given by the quadratic sum of the density matrix elements over occupied atomic orbitals[^1] on atoms A and B:

\begin{equation} W_{AB} = \sum_{\mu\in A}\sum_{\nu\in B} P^2_{\mu\nu} \end{equation}

[^1]: For non-minimal basis sets, AOs are often non-orthogonal and require normalization for the WBO to be valid. In the case of WBOs in Psi4 [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00174], the LÃ¶wdin normalization [@doi:10.1063/1.1747632; @doi:10/bdfk5f] scheme is used.

### 2.3 The WBO is an inexpensive surrogate for monitoring changes in the chemical environment around a bond

Since the WBO can be calculated from an inexpensive AM1 calculation, is indicative of a bond's conjugation, and is correlated with torsion energy barrier height, it is attractive to use for interpolating torsion force constants.
However, WBOs are conformation-dependent [@doi:10.1039/c6ra17055b; @doi:10.1021/ja00029a005], so we further investigated this dependence to understand if WBOs will be a robust descriptor.
In addition, we also investigated the generality of the torsion energy barrier and WBO linear relationship.
In this section, we will first discuss our findings and solution to the conformation dependency and then discuss the generality of the WBO linear relationship with torsion barrier height.

#### 2.3.1 Conformation-dependent variance of WBOs are higher for conjugated bonds

Because they are a function of the electron density, WBOs are necessarily conformation-dependent.
However, not all bond WBOs change the same way with conformation.
We found that WBOs for conjugated bonds have higher variance with respect to conformation and that bonds involved in conjugated systems have WBOs that are correlated with each other.
This makes sense in terms of our qualitative understanding of conjugation strength depending on the alignment of $\pi$ orbitals across the conjugated system: as the change of a distal torsion disrupts the $\pi$ orbital alignment, the strength of that conjugation on the local torsion barrier decreases.

![**Variance and correlations of Wiberg bond order distributions with respect to conformations are higher for conjugated bonds.**
**[A]** Gefitinib, with its rotatable bonds highlighted and numbered to correspond with figures B and C.
**[B]** WBO distributions over 232 conformations of the highlighted, rotatable bonds.
The colors of the distributions correspond to
the colors in the highlighted bonds in A.
The variance and their 95% confidence interval are shown on the left (with exponent base of 1E-5).
The single non conjugated bonds (blue, (10, 11), red (11, 12), and olive (12, 13)) have lower variance than conjugated bonds (yellow (3, 2), purple (8, 9), orange (9, 10), grey (23, 19), and green(24, 24)).
**[C]** Correlation plot of WBOs every bond in Gefitinib against WBOs of all other bonds over 232 conformations.
The white lines indicate ring systems.
Bonds in conjugated systems have higher correlations between their WBOs (see the aromatic ring systems in the two lower right diagonal squares).
Both bonds (23, 19) (grey) and (24, 23) (green) have WBOs that are correlated with their neighboring ring systems, but bond (23, 19) are more correlated with the ring systems than the green bond (24, 23).
**[D]** Resonance structures of Gefitinib illustrate why the grey bond (23, 19) has higher variance than the green bond (24, 23) even if
both bonds are conjugated.
When the double bond is on bond (23, 19), the negative charge is on a nitrogen which is the more stable form, vs the resonance structure where the double bond is on (24, 23) with the negative charge on a carbon.
**[E]** The conformations of the molecule for the highest WBO and lowest in the distribution.
The mode with higher WBOs has bond (23, 19) in plane with quinazoline which allows for stronger conjugation while the mode with lower WBOs has the bond out of plane so there is less electron population overlap in out of plane conformation.](images/figure-4.svg){#fig:wbo_var_corr}

To investigate how WBOs change with conformation, we used Omega [@doi:10.1021/ci100031x] to generate conformers for a set of kinase inhibitors (SI Figure @fig:kinase_inhibitors) and calculated the WBO for each conformation from a B3LYP-D3(BJ) / DZVP [@doi:10.1139/v92-079; @doi:10.1063/1.464913; @doi:10.1063/1.3382344; @doi:10.1002/jcc.21759] geometry optimized calculation using Psi4 [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00174].
Omega is a knowledge-based conformer generator that uses a modified version of MMFF94s [@doi:10/brxdg7] to score conformations.
It has been shown to accurately reproduce experimentally observed crystallography conformers in the Platinum benchmark dataset [@doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00505].

Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr illustrates the results for Gefitinib (Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr, A), a representative molecule.
Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr, B shows the distribution of WBOs for all rotatable bonds color-coded with the colors used to highlight the bonds in Gefitinib (Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr, A).
Single carbon-carbon bonds and carbon-nitrogen bonds formed by atoms numbered 10-13 are freely rotating.
This is reflected by the tighter distribution (lower variance) of WBOs around closer to one for those bonds.

The bonds involving the ether oxygens and aromatic rings (formed by atoms numbered 1-3, 8-10, 19, 23-24) exhibit higher variance.
It is interesting to note the difference in the WBOs for the conjugated bonds formed by the nitrogen between the quinazoline and chloro fluoro phenyl (bonds formed by atoms numbered 19, 23 and 23, 24).
Both of these bonds are conjugated with their neighboring ring systems.
However, while the distribution of WBOs for bond 23-19 (the grey distribution) has two clear modes of almost equal weights, the WBO distribution for bond 24-23 has lower variance.
This is in agreement with the resonance structures shown in Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr.

The resonance structures that have the double bond on the bond closer to the quinazoline (bond 19-23) are more stable because the negative charge is on a nitrogen.
When the double bond is on the neighboring 23-24 bond, the negative charge is on an aromatic carbon which is less stable.
The results are similar for other kinase inhibitors tested shown in SI Figure @fig:kinase_inhibitors.

In addition, when we inspected the conformations associated with the highest and lowest WBO in the grey distribution (Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr, E) we found that conformations with lowest WBO on bond 19-23 had that bond out of plane while the conformation with the highest WBO value had the bond in plane which allows conjugation.
We found similar results from WBOs calculated form QC torsion scans.
Figure @fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan shows the WBO for each point in the QC corresponding torsion scans.
The WBOs are anti-correlated with the torsion potential energy which is in line with chemical intuition.
Conjugation stabilizes conformations and leads to more electronic population overlap in bonds [@doi:10.1351/pac198961040635].
At higher energy conformers, the aromatic rings are out of plane and cannot conjugate.
Therefore the WBO is lower for those conformers.
At lower energy conformations, the rings are in plane and can conjugate so the WBO is higher.
We found that the trends discusses above are similar when using semi-empirical methods such as AM1 (SI Figure @fig:si_wbo_dist).
For other levels of QC theory and for the Mayer bond order, the results can be different as discussed in the SI.

#### 2.3.2 Bonds in conjugated systems have highly correlated conformation-dependent WBOs

We found that certain bond orders are strongly correlated or anti-correlated with each other, indicating strong electronic coupling.
As bonds in one conformation gain electron population overlap, the coupled bonds will decrease in electron population overlap and vice versa.
Figure @fig:wbo_var_corr, C shows the Pearson correlation coefficient for each bond WBO distribution against all other bond WBO distributions.
There is a clear structure in this correlation plot. The square formed by bonds from atoms 24-29 shows that the alternating bonds in the aromatic ring (25-29) are strongly anti-correlated with each other.

This trend is different in the ring formed by atoms 13-18, which is not aromatic.
In this ring, bonds 13-18, 13-14, 16-15 and 16-17 (which involve electron rich atoms O and N) have Pearson correlation coefficients with absolute values higher than for the other bonds in the ring, but lower than the bonds in the aromatic ring.
The bonds involved in the methoxy groups (atoms 1-3 and 8-10) are correlated with each other and also correlated to the quinazoline, albeit not as strongly.
The bonds between the chloro fluoro phenyl and quinazoline follow the same trend as their WBO distribution and resonance structures.
The bond closer to the quinazoline (bond 23-19) has WBO distribution correlated with the quinazoline while the bond closer to the
chloro fluoro phenyl (bond 23-24) is not as strongly coupled with the quinazoline.

The trends are similar for other kinase inhibitors examined, as shown in SI Figure @fig:kinase_inhibitors.

#### 2.3.3 Electronically least-interacting functional group (ELF) method provides a useful way to capture informative conformation-independent WBOs

![**Standard deviations of conformation-dependent WBO distributions are smaller than standard deviations of WBO distribution of the same bond in different chemical environments.**
The distribution of standard deviations of WBO distributions over conformations is shown in blue.
The distribution of standard deviations of ELF10 WBO distributions for the same bond in different chemical environments is shown in pink.
The changes in WBO due to conformations are smaller than the changes in WBO due to chemical changes around the bond.
The validation set (SI Figure @fig:full_validation_set), was used to generate these distributions. The blue standard deviation distribution was calculated over 140602 WBO dependent distributions (this is the number of individual fragments in the dataset).
The pink standard deviation distribution was calculated over 366 distributions of 366 bonds in different chemical environments (of the 140602 fragments)](images/standard_deviations.svg){#fig:standard_deviations}

As we have shown, the WBO is conformation-dependent and this dependency can also be highly informative of the electronic couplings within a system.
Figure @fig:standard_deviations shows the distribution of standard deviations of the conformation-dependent WBO distribution in blue.
Most of the standard deviations fall below 0.03, which is encouragingly small.
However, it can become computationally expensive to calculate the WBO for all conformations; if we aim to use WBOs as a surrogate to determine if our fragment is representative of the parent molecule in a reproducible way, we need a way to capture informative conformation-independent WBOs.
The Electronically Least-interacting Functional groups (ELF) conformation selection scheme implemented in the OpenEye Toolkit `quacpac` module [@url:https://docs.eyesopen.com/applications/quacpac/index.html] resolves the issue of sensitivity of molecular mechanics electrostatic energies from QC derived charges.

The ELF10 method begins with a large set of conformers for the molecule.
MMFF94 charges [@doi:10/brxdg7] are assigned to the molecule, set to their absolute value, and then single-point Coulomb electrostatic energies evaluated for each conformer.
The lowest-energy 2% of conformers are selected, and if there are more than 10, from these the most diverse 10 are selected.
For this final conformer set (up to 10 conformers), the AM1 WBOs and charges for each conformer are averaged (by bond and by atom, respectively) and the BCCs are applied to the charges [@doi:10.1002/jcc.10128].
This method yields a set of AM1-BCC atomic partial charges and WBOs for the molecule which are relatively insensitive to the initial choice of conformer set, and which mitigate two pathologies of AM1-BCC charges: peculiar charges resulting from strong intramolecular electrostatic interactions (e.g. from internal hydrogen bonds or formal charges) and simple conformational variance.

![**Distribution of WBO in drug-like molecules is concentrated near chemically sensible values.**
**[A]** The distribution of all WBOs for all bonds in molecules in set. The mode at one, close to two and close to three correspond to
single, double and triple bonds. the density between one and two correspond to aromatic and conjugated bonds. The mode at ~0.7 correspond
to bonds that include sulfur and phosphorous which are longer, weaker bonds. **[B]** The blue distribution includes carbon - carbon bonds that
are not in rings. The modes at one, two and three correspond to single, double and triple bonds. The pink distribution include bonds that are in rings.
The mode at one corresponds to single bonds and the density between one and 1.5 are aromatics. **[C]** The blue distribution includes bonds that have
either one or two nitrogens. Many of these bonds are conjugated as demonstrated by the density around 1.5. The density at three corresponds to
nitriles. The pink distribution include bonds that have oxygens. The mode at two corresponds to carbonyls.](images/figure-2_4.svg){#fig:wbo_dists}

This method can also be applied to produce WBOs that are insensitive to conformers.
To check how well AM1 ELF10 estimated WBOs recapitulates the multiplicity of bonds, we calculated WBOs from AM1 ELF10 calculations for all bonds in a set of molecules shown in SI Figure @fig:wbo_dist_mols.
The distribution in Figure @fig:wbo_dists corresponds closely with bond multiplicity.
The density at ~0.7 correspond to bonds involving sulfur and phosphorous since these are weaker and longer bonds.
The mode at ~1.0 corresponds to C-H and C-C bonds, the mode close to 1.5 corresponds to bonds in aromatic rings, the mode close to 2.0 corresponds to double bonds, and finally the triple bonds form the last peak.

Figures @fig:wbo_dists B and D separate out different kinds of bonds to more clearly illustrate what the WBO captures.
Figure @fig:wbo_dists B shows carbon - carbon bonds not in rings (blue) and bonds in rings (pink).
The carbon-carbon distribution has distinct modes at one, two and three corresponding to single, double and triple bonds. There is also a smaller mode at 1.5 that corresponds to conjugated bonds.
The pink distribution includes bonds in rings and has modes at one and 1.5 which corresponds to aliphatic and aromatic rings, respectively.
Figure @fig:wbo_dists D shows distributions with bonds that have nitrogens (blue) and oxygens (pink).
The peaks occur at chemically sensible values; 1, 1.5 and 3 for nitrogen which corresponds to single, conjugated and triple bonds and 1 and 2 for oxygens which correspond to single and carbonyl bonds.
For the rest of this section, we focus on the robustness and generalizability of ELF10 WBOs.

#### 2.3.4 WBOs are a robust signal of how torsion barrier heights depend on remote chemical changes

To investigate how resonance and electronic effects from remote substituents change the torsion energy of a bond, we took inspiration from the Hammett equation [@doi:10.1021/ja01280a022] of reactions involving benzoic acid derivatives.
The Hammett equation relates meta and para benzoic acid substituents to the acid's ionization equilibrium constants

\begin{equation} log \frac{K}{K_0} = \sigma\rho \end{equation}

Here, $\sigma$ is a substituent constant and $\rho$ is a reaction constant.
It aims to isolate the resonance and inductive effects
of substituents from the sterics effects of a reaction. Here, we generated a combinatorial set of meta- and para-substituted phenyls
and pyridine (Figure @fig:substituted_phenyls, A) with 26 functional groups that cover a wide range of electron donating and withdrawing groups.
We then calculated the AM1 ELF10 WBO for the bond attaching the functional group to the aromatic ring (highlighted green in
Figure @fig:substituted_phenyls, A) for all functional groups which resulted in 133 (26 * 5 + 3) WBOs for each functional group in different chemical environments.
This allowed us to isolate the effect on a bond's WBO from remote chemical environment changes, defined as a change more than two bonds away, from other effects such as sterics and conformations.
The resulting distributions are in Figure @fig:substituted_phenyls, B.
(Details on generating and accessing this set are provided in Section 5.3.2 in the Detailed Methods.)


It is interesting to note that the trend of decreasing WBOs for more electron donating groups are anticorrelates with increasing Hammett substituent constants.
In SI Figure @fig:hammett, the AM1 ELF10 WBOs of the bonds between the functional group and benzoic acid are plotted against their Hammett meta and para substituent constants (values were taken from Hansch et al. [@doi:10.1021/cr00002a004]).
Functional groups that are more electron donating will have more electron density on the bond attaching the functional group to the benzoic acid.
The resonance and/or inductive effect destabilize the benzoate, increases its pKa, which corresponds to lower substituent constants.

Table: **Slope and associated statistics for torsion barrier height vs WBO for selected functional groups.** {#tbl:stats}

To investigate how these long range effects observed in the WBOs capture changes in the bonds' torsion potential energy, we ran representative QC torsion scans for 17 of these functional groups (SI Figures @fig:phenyl_td_1, @fig:phenyl_td_2, @fig:phenyl_td_3, @fig:phenyl_td_4  @fig:phenyl_td_5).
We did not run QC torsion scans for the following functional groups:
* functional groups did not have a torsion such as halogens
* functional groups that were congested (such as trimethyl amonium)
* functional groups where the WBOs did not change by more than 0.01 for different functional groups at the meta or para position such as methyl.
We chose the representative molecules for the 17 functional groups by sorting the molecules within each functional group by their WBO and selecting molecules with minimum WBO difference of 0.02.
All of the resulting QC torsion scans are shown in SI Figures @fig:phenyl_td_1, @fig:phenyl_td_2, @fig:phenyl_td_3, @fig:phenyl_td_4, @fig:phenyl_td_5.
Table @tbl:stats lists the slopes and associated statistics for the fitted lines.

#### 2.3.5 Conformation-dependent WBOs differentiate between though-space and through-bond non-local effects on QC torsion scans

We show representative series of torsion scans in Figure @fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan and the corresponding conformation-dependant WBO at each conformation in the scan.
A QC torsion scan contains contributions of through-bond effects such as conjugation and / or hyperconjugation and through-space effects such as sterics and electrostatics interactions \cite{Wei2019,Liu2018,Goodman2005}.
In this section we show how WBOs can be used to characterize through-space and through-space effects in QC torsion scans.

As a molecule is rotated about its bond to generate a QC torsion scan, changes in conjugation and / or hyperconjugation, the conformation of the rest of the molecule, and non-local, through-space interactions contribute to the potential energy surface that is then used to fit MM torsion parameters.
The torsion parameters in classical force fields are supposed to include both conjugation, a through-bond electron delocalization phenomenon that is not well modeled in classical forcefields, and corrections for 1-4 non-bonded interactions.
To increase their transferability, torsion parameters should not include non-bonded interactions beyond the 1-4 atoms.
However, in general, it is difficult to separate the contributions of sterics and conjugation in a QC torsion scan.
In this section we characterize steric and conjugation and / or hyperconjugation contributions to QC scans using the corresponding WBO scans.
Below is a summary of these observations from the subsituted phenyl torsion scans.

1. When QC torsion scans are anti-correlated with conformation-dependent WBOs calculated for conformations in the scan, differences in QC torsion scans for the same torsion types in different chemical environments are a result of non-local, through-bond effects.
   If changes in QC torsion scans are not accompanied by highly anti-correlated WBOs, the changes are due to non-local, through-space, effects
2. When AM1 ELF10 WBOs do not obey the trend found in \cite{Stern2020} of the linear relationship with torsion barrier height for the same torsion type in different chemical environments, they are generally caused by non-local, through-space interactions.

**[E]** Same as **A** but with urea at the X~1~ position.
**[F]** Same as **B** but for urea in a series of different chemical environment. Both profiles and
energy barriers change with AM1 ELF10 WBOs. In addition, the grey scan has higher energy barriers than the olive scan but its ELF10 WBO is lower.
**[G]** Same as **[C]** but for urea. Here, the WBO scans all have the same profiles while the QC torsion scan does not.
**[H]** Same as **D** but here the WBO scans are not always anti-correlated or not as strongly anti-correlated.
The WBO scan profiles do not change because the changes in the QC torsion scan captures spatial effects while the WBO scans capture conjugation.](images/example_scans.svg){#fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan}

\FIG{example-scans} shows three series of QC torsion scans for the same torsion type in different chemical environments to illustrate this.
\FIG{example-scans} A, E and I show three torsion types (nitro, urea and amino) in different chemical environments with their associated AM1 ELF10 WBO.
\FIG{example-scans} B, F, and J show their QC torsion scans, \FIG{example-scans} C, G, and K show their conformation-dependent WBOs along the torsion scan, and \FIG{example-scans} D, H, and L show the correlations between conformer energies and their conformer-dependent WBOs.

\FIG{example-scans} A-D show what is generally the expected behavior of QC torsion scans for the same torsion types in different chemical environments as shown in the previous chapter \cite{Stern2020}.
(\FIG{example-scans}, A and B).
The QC torsion profiles in \FIG{example-scans}, B, are all the same, while the torsion barrier heights increase with increasing AM1 ELF10 WBOs.
WBOs calculated at every point of the QC torsion scan generate a profile that is generally anti-correlated to QC torsion scans as shown in \FIG{example-scans}, C and D.
This is in line with chemical intuition.
Increased conjugation is a result of increased electron population overlap which stabilizes conformations and decreases their energy.

The second derivative of WBOs along a QC torsion scan also changes depending on how strongly the bond conjugates at its lowest energy conformation.
For bonds with higher AM1 ELF10 WBOs (\FIG{example-scans}, A and E) which indicates increased conjugation, the rate of change in the WBO scans are higher than for the same torsion types in environments where the bond does not conjugate as strongly (\FIG{example-scans}, C and G).
This also makes sense with respect to chemical intuition.
At high energy conformations, where electronic orbitals are not oriented to conjugate, WBOs of the same bond in different chemical environments will be closer to each other than at lower energy where electronic delocalization is also a function of long distance chemical changes.
In other words, conjugation is disrupted similarly for the different chemical environment, but the extent of conjugation is different because of different remote substituents.

\FIG{example-scans} E-H shows a different series of the same torsion type in different chemical environments.
There are several differences between this example and the example discussed in the previous paragraph.
One, while the torsion types are equivalent for all four molecules shown in \FIG{example-scans} E, the QC torsion scans do not all have the same profile.
Relative heights of minima and maxima are different or new minima and maxima are observed.
In addition, their corresponding conformation-dependent WBO scans are not as strongly anti-correlated with the torsion scans (\FIG{example-scans}, H) as in \FIG{example-scans} D.
Interestingly, the WBO scans do all have similar profiles (\FIG{example-scans} G).
In this example, the urea is a more bulky functional group than the nitro and amino group in Figures \FIG{example-scans} A and I.
The red and grey molecules also have bulky groups at the meta position relative to the torsion being driven. This creates different steric clashes for the different molecules and changes their QC torsion profiles relative to each others.
However, the conformation-dependant WBO scans have similar profiles for the molecules in the series because the non-local through-bond effects are similar for the molecules in this series.
These WBO scans are not as anti-correlated to the QC scan as in the previous examples (-0.98, -0.99, -1.00 vs 0.7, -0.61, -0.97 and -0.67).
The blue scan is actually correlated instead of being anti-correlated.
Because while the electrons can conjugate when the torsion is in a planar position, the clashes of the proximal hydrogen and oxygen increase the energy.
This small barrier at 0$^\circ$ does not exist in the grey and gold scan because the trimethylamonium is electron withdrawing, that the urea group can better conjugate with the phenyl ring and this stabilization is greater than the steric interactions.

This series also shows an example of molecules that do not follow the trend shown in \cite{Stern2020} where increasing AM1 ELF10 WBO corresponds to increasing torsion barrier heights.
The grey torsion scan (\FIG{example-scans} F) has torsion barrier heights that is ~15 kJ/mol greater than the gold torsion scan, while its AM1 ELF10 WBO is lower than the gold molecules (1.10 vs 1.11).
This happens because the trimethylamonium is a bulky group at the meta position and it interacts with the carbonyl in the urea which causes the the barrier heights to increase.
The scans shown here were taken from the subsituted phenyl set described in the previous chapter \cite{Stern2020}.
I observed this trend of bulky groups on the meta position clashing in most other cases where the AM1 ELF10 WBOs did not follow the trend of increasing torsion barrier heights.

Figures \FIG{example-scans} I-L show yet another series of torsion scans that exhibit different behaviors than both examples already discussed.
In this example, QC torsion scans in \FIG{example-scans} J all have different profiles, specifically, the symmetry around zero is lost in the blue and red scan, albeit differently.
The blue scan shifted such that the minima are not at 0$^\circ$ and 180$^\circ$ but the barrier heights are equivalent.
In the red scan, one barrier is ~10 kJ/mol higher than the other.
However, in these scans, the corresponding WBO scans are anti-correlated with the torsion scans (\FIG{example-scans}, L).
Because in these cases, these changes are due to changes in conjugation, not because of non-local steric interactions.
All of these molecules contain a trivalent nitrogen that can assume both a pyramidal and planar conformation, depending on the amount of electron density in the lone pair.
The more electron density there is in the lone pair, the greater the angle of the pyramidal nitrogen will be.
If the lone pairs conjugate with other $\pi$ electrons, the trivalent nitrogen adopts a planar conformation to accommodate conformation and because there is less electron density in the lone pair now that it is delocalized.
\FIG{improper-nitrogen} shows how the angle of the trivalent nitrogen involved in the torsion changes over the course of the torsion scan.
The blue scan, which corresponds with the molecule with a low AM1 ELF10 WBO relative to other bonds of the same torsion type (1.06), does not conjugate with the phenyl ring and remains in a pyramidal with an angle of ~ 35$^\circ$.
This creates a chiral center which is reflected in the shift of the blue torsion scan in \FIG{example-scans} J and the loss of symmetry around zero.
The red scan also which also corresponds to a molecule with a lower AM1 ELF10 WBO relative to other bonds with this torsion type (1.10), also does not conjugated and remains pyramidal throughout the entire scan.
However, in this scan, the chirality of the pyramidal nitrogen does flip, but then does not flip again at ~100$^\circ$ which can explain why the barrier heights are so different from one another.
Lastly, the gold scan which corresponds to a molecule with a relatively high AM1 ELF10 WBO (1.24) does conjugate at a torsion angle of zero and the trivalent nitrogen becomes planar with an improper torsion angle of zero.

The general trend I found when looking at other molecules in the subsituted phenyl set shared in \cite{Stern2020} was that when trivalent nitrogen were involved in a torsion scan, changes in the torsion profile relative to the same torsion type in different chemical environments, were due to changes in non-local through-bond effects.
These changes were also universally reflected in the corresponding WBO scans that remained anti-correlated with the QC scan.
Specifically, torsions involving trivalent nitrogens with relatively lower AM1 ELF10 WBOs for the central bond, were more likely to exhibited such changes.
In all cases where such changes were observed, the trivalent nitrogens did not form planar conformations at appropriate points in the scan to conjugate with the neighboring phenyl ring.

Calculating conformation-dependent WBOs for torsion scan is computationally cheap relative to a full QC scan, and the information gleaned from it can be helpful in differentiating non-local through-bond and through-space effects.
In general, when the conformation-dependent WBO scan is not strongly anti-correlated with the QC torsion scan, the QC scan contains through-space steric effects.
When the conformation-dependent WBO scans are strongly anti-correlated with QC scans, especially when those profiles have loss of symmetry and the torsion atoms include a trivalent nitrogen, the changes in QC torsion profiles relative to QC scans of the same torsion type in different chemical environments are usually a result from through-bond effects and need to be incorporated in classical torsion force field parameters.

### 2.4 Wiberg bond orders can be used to interpolate torsion parameters








We show a representative series of torsion scan for the nitro functional group in figure {@fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan}A. The torsion energy barrier height increased with increasing ELF10 WBO of the bond.
In addition, {@fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan}B  shows that the Wiberg-Lowdin bond orders are anti-correlated with the QC torsion scan which is the same result we saw for the initial biphenyl set discussed in the previous section.
We also found that the linear relationship between WBOs and torsion energy barrier height shown in Figures @fig:biphenyls, E generalizes to the functional groups tested in this set (Figure {@fig:substituted_phenyls} C and D).
However, some X~1~ we tested do not fully follow the trend so we separated the lines into Figure @fig:substituted_phenyls C for X~1~ that have lines with r^2^ > 0.7 and Figure @fig:substituted_phenyls D for X~1~ that have lines with r^2^ < 0.7.
Table @tbl:stats lists the slopes and associated statistics for the fitted lines.

For most functional groups, the change in WBOs correspond to changes in torsion barrier heights (SI Figures @fig:phenyl_td_1 - @fig:phenyl_td_5).
However, for some functional groups, not only do the scales change, but the profile changes considerably as shown in Figure @fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan, C (Urea).
Interestingly, the Wiberg bond order scans do have the same profiles (Figure {@fig:sub_phenyl_qc_scan} D). These phenomena and the discrepancies observed in Figure @fig:substituted_phenyls D, are discussed in more detail in section 4.3 in the discussion.

When we compare the standard deviations of WBO distributions with respect to conformation versus with respect to changes in chemical space (Figure @fig:standard_deviations, pink distribution), we find that the changes in ELF10 WBO for remote chemical environment changes are usually bigger than the changes in WBO that arise from change in conformation.
This allows us to use the difference in ELF10 WBO of parent and fragment as a good surrogate to the level of disruption of the chemical environment.
